## The Setup

[Watch it on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feeAAJLSqjw)

1. Give each player **1** _Move 2 Steps_ card.
1. Shuffle and place the Deck **facing up** in an accessible location.
1. Take **4** cards from the top of the Deck and place them beside the Deck. This is the Drafting Area. 
1. Each time a card is drafted from the Drafting Area, replace the card with another from the top of the Deck.
1. Each player takes turns taking **2** cards from the Drafting Area until every player is holding **5** cards.

## Basic Game Rules
1. Each player can hold a maximum of **5** cards.
1. At the end of their turn, the player drafts **2** cards from the Drafting Area.
1. When drafting, if a player is already holding **4** cards, they can only draft **1** card, if a player is already holding **5** cards, they cannot draft any cards.
1. When moving, Ducks cannot pass through any space already occupied by Ducks or Bombs.
1. The floating buoys on the map are obstacles, Ducks cannot move through them. 
1. When Bombs are initialised, all Ducks adjacent to the Bomb will be pushed one step away from the Bomb.
1. Players can only trigger Bombs planted by their own Ducks or cards.

### Tips* 
* Bombs can act as obstacles.
* Bombs can to used to trigger other Bombs, including those planted by another player. 
* If you do not have any appropriate tokens, you may mark the space with a pencil instead. Use different colours or symbols to represent Bombs planted by different players. 
* Players can use all **5** cards on their turn.
